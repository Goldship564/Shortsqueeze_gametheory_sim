Interpretation:
Day 1-2: RI buys, reducing float and nudging the price up. HF holds, hoping for a drop.
Day 3: Price spikes, HF covers 20k shares, amplifying the squeeze.
Day 4: HF covers more, RI sells some shares at the peak, price surges to $421.88.
Day 5: Stalemate, price holds.
Result: HF loses big (-$18.47M) due to uncovered shorts at a high price; RI profits ($6.33M) from holding.
Enhancements
Realism: Add volatility (random noise), margin calls, or more players (e.g., market makers).
Data: Use historical short interest or volume to calibrate.
Visualization: Plot price over time with Matplotlib.
Would you like me to refine this (e.g., add noise, plot results) or tweak the strategies? Let me know!
